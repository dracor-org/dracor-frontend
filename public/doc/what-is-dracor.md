# What is DraCor?

*"DraCor = estrategia de guerrilla mediante estándares" ([José Calvo Tello](https://twitter.com/eumanismo/status/1218066125969412096))*

**DraCor is not a website.** DraCor is a showcase for the concept of [Programmable Corpora](https://dev.clariah.nl/files/dh2019/boa/0268.html). It revolves around an API that provides data extracted from [TEI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative)-encoded corpora. This website – dracor.org – uses this API to showcase some of the extractable information. Some data can be downloaded through the web interface. The more powerful, direct access point is the [documented API](https://dracor.org/documentation/api/).

**DraCor is short for "drama corpora"**, a growing collection of plays in (mostly) European languages. We're maintaining some in-house corpora which we built from the ground up (GerDraCor and RusDraCor). We also adapted (and enhanced) some corpora that were released under free licenses. We also host corpora maintained by others. Feel free to contact us if are interested.

**DraCor is an ecosystem.** You can connect to it on different levels. There are corpora, which you can freely use, even independently of the platform itself. There is an interface providing access to specific slices of the corpora, i.e. research data extracted live from up-to-date corpora. There are low-threshold apps letting you explore different aspects of the corpora (like our [DraCor Shiny app](https://shiny.dracor.org/) that lets you toy around with co-occurrence networks). We are working on API wrappers for Python, R and Haskell. But in general, you are free to connect to the API the way you prefer. You can be an active part of the DraCor ecosystem. (For inspiration, we still lack Twitter bots based on our API. 😊)

**DraCor will be part of the Linked Open Data cloud.** We use Wikidata (and other) identifiers for authors and plays and provide a SPARQL endpoint for many entities comprised in our corpora (like characters). Our LOD component is still in development, though, not ready for production.

**DraCor wants to create an interface between traditional and digital literary studies.** The extent to which you can involve DraCor in your research on European drama (or literature in general), depends on your level of technical expertise (or support). We are part of the continuous learning process that accompanies the practice of Digital Humanities and actively support the creation of more teaching and training material around DraCor.

DraCor as a concept and the platform dracor.org were initially developed by digital humanists at Higher School of Economics, Moscow. The website is hosted at University of Potsdam. For a full list of credits, please see our Credits page.
