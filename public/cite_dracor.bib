	abstract = {DraCor (short for "drama corpora") is a growing collection of TEI-encoded plays in (mostly) European languages. The project showcases the concept of "Programmable Corpora", conceived as research ecosystems revolving around an API that provides access to bespoke slices of extracted data. DraCor also exposes a SPARQL endpoint to connect its semantic entities (authors, plays, characters, etc.) to the Linked Open Data cloud.},
